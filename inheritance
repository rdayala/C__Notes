Inheritance is one of the important feature of OOP which allows us to make hierarchical classifications of classes. 

In this, we can create a general class which defines the most common features. 
Other more specific classes can inherit this class to define those features that are unique to them. 
In this case, the classes which inherit from other classes, is referred as derived class.

Single Inheritance : A (parent class) → B (child class)
Multiple Inheritance : A → C, B → C
Hierarchical Inheritance : A → B, A → C, A → D
Multilevel Inheritance : A → B, B → C
Hybrid Inheritance : A → B, A → C, B → D, C → D

class vehicle
{
   int fuel_cap;
   public:
      drive();
};

class car : public vehicle
{
   public:
      roll_windows();
};

class bike : public vehicle
{
   public:
      kick_start();
};
