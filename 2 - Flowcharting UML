Flowcharts are a great way to create a visual representation of our program.

  Forces us to break our program into pieces.
  This shows us the processes needed to create our solution.
  From these flowcharts, we can start to encapsulate portions of our code into smaller functions.
  
  Symbols:
  
    Circle - start/end of the process.
    Rectangle - action or the process to do
    Diamond - decision, either true or false
    Data - trapezium
    Files - 
    
  Example : Cash register at a grocessory store. Start with scanning an item, add item cost to the total, check for more items, report total.
    
UML diagrams provide a visual representation, of any classes we need to create.


Algorithm - is a list of steps needed to solve a problem.
