There are many environments available.

Either u can use:

  Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers ( Free, open source download)
    
    download it from, eclipse.org 
    
  Microsoft Visual Studio.
  
--->

To use Eclipse, we need three things:
  
  1. JRE
  2. GNU GCC compiler
  3. Eclipse with CDT, C++ Development Tools
  
Checking if JRE is installed or not?

  go to java.com --> click on Do I have Java? link 
  
--->
Downloading GCC compiler :

  www.equation.com
    --> choose Programming Tools -> chose Fortran, C, C++ -> here you can chose the software to download.
    
  On windows, when installing choose directory as C:\MinGW, this is because it's the default directory that the Eclipse IDE is going to look for the compiler.
